# CoinkInterface

This is a simple interface with a login and a main table with filters and sorting that gets the data from the Rick and Morty API

## How to initialize and build the project

First you should use a node version compatible with Angular 15, for example node ^14.20.0 || ^16.13.0 || ^18.10.0, then you must run npm install and then npm run build to build the application bundle.
You don't need any specific email nor password in the login, just put any email and password and click the "Iniciar sesi√≥n" button
